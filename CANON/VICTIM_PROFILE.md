**How it manifests:**
- Trusts everyone implicitly, especially women
- Shares food without hesitation
- Cannot imagine someone wanting to hurt her

**How it kills them:**
Her inability to suspect Petra - her roommate, her "new best friend" - means she keeps drinking the poisoned smoothies even as her body deteriorates.

## Personality

1. Generous - shares everything, including the poisoned food Petra "made for her"
2. Trusting - believes Petra's concern about her health is genuine friendship

### Negative Traits (that seal their fate)
1. Oblivious - doesn't notice Petra's micro-aggressions or forced smiles
2. Self-absorbed - talks about her brand deal while Petra seethes silently

### Pet Peeves
- Bad lighting
- People who don't understand "content creation is real work"
- Hostels without fast Wi-Fi

### Fears
- Surface fear: Losing followers
- Deeper fear: That she's not actually talented, just lucky and pretty

## Background

### Origin Story
Second-generation Chinese-American from San Diego. Parents are successful doctors who wanted her to pursue medicine. Instead, she started a travel blog in college that exploded. Now earns six figures from partnerships, lives entirely on the road, and rarely speaks to her disappointed parents.

### Why They Travel
It's her job - but also, she genuinely loves seeing new places and can't imagine living any other way.

### How They Ended Up at This Hostel
Scouting hostels in Bali for a sponsored post. The hostel offered her free accommodation in exchange for content. She's staying in the dorm "for authenticity" instead of a private room.

## Voice & Speech

### Vocabulary
- Uses words like: "Obsessed," "Iconic," "Game-changer," "Literally dying"
- Avoids words like: Anything negative about sponsors or places she's been comped
- Catchphrases: "This is SO Instagram" / "Content is king"

### Speech Pattern
- Upspeak (sentences end like questions?)
- Lots of filler words
- Switches between influencer-speak and genuine vulnerability
- Voice gets higher when performing for camera

### Internal Monologue Style
A mix of genuine wonder at the world and constant calculation about content angles. Reads like someone seeing everything through a camera lens.

## Digital Presence

### Social Media
- **Platform of choice:** Instagram (primary), TikTok (growing)
- **Follower count:** 487,000 on Instagram
- **Posting style:** Aspirational travel content, "authentic" vulnerable moments, partnership posts for hotels and gear brands
- **Last post before death:** Bali rice terraces with caption "Sometimes the journey is the destination" #ad #BaliBabe

### Online vs Reality
Projects effortless success; privately anxious about algorithm changes and younger influencers coming up. Works 12-hour days editing and responding to DMs.

## Relationships

### Family
- Mother (Dr. Linda Chen): Disapproves of her career, rarely speaks to her
- Father (Dr. Kevin Chen): More supportive but distant
- No siblings

### Friends
- Has 487,000 followers and zero close friends
- Travel acquaintances who appear in photos but aren't really known

### Romantic
- Single, "focused on her brand" - but lonely

### At the Hostel
- Immediately bonds with Petra, who seems "so different" from other girls
- Unaware that Petra is studying her, hating her, planning

## The Day They Die

### Morning
Wakes up feeling terrible - again. The stomach problems have been going on for a week. Petra brings her a smoothie "to help settle your tummy." Maddie drinks it gratefully, posts a story about her "wellness journey."

### Their Last Normal Moment
Editing photos in bed while Petra watches, asking questions about her workflow. Maddie is happy someone cares about her work. She doesn't notice the coldness in Petra's eyes.

### Final Thoughts
Confusion. The hospital bed, the doctors saying words she doesn't understand. Why won't her body work? She wants her mom.

### Last Words
"Can you call Petra? She should know I'm here..."

## Writing This Character

### POV Notes
When in this character's head:
- They notice: Lighting, backgrounds, potential photo opportunities, engagement metrics
- They ignore: Petra's jealousy, her own worsening symptoms, real human connection
- They judge: Places by their "Instagrammability," people by their follower counts (unconsciously)

### Key Scenes Checklist
- [x] Introduction scene establishing archetype - filming content while other guests watch, annoyed
- [x] Fatal flaw demonstration (early) - shares food with Petra without asking where it came from
- [x] Sympathetic moment (make reader care) - phone call with mom where she tries to reconnect and fails
- [x] Warning ignored scene - other guest mentions Petra is "weird" about her, Maddie dismisses it
- [x] Point of no return - keeps consuming Petra's "health drinks" despite worsening condition
- [x] The death
