### The Death Location (Specific)
**Where exactly does the death occur?**
Technically, Maddie dies in BIMC Hospital, Denpasar - a private hospital 30 minutes from the hostel. But the poisoning occurs throughout the hostel, primarily in the communal kitchen (where Petra makes the poisoned smoothies) and in Dorm C, the 6-bed female dorm where both women stay. Dorm C has individual bunk pods with curtains for privacy, making Petra's activities largely invisible.

## The Staff

### Reception
**Name:** Putu
**Description:** Early 20s Balinese man, charming and efficient. Knows all the influencers by their handles before their real names.
**Role in death:** Oblivious - saw Petra cooking often but thought nothing of it. Later provides information to police.

### Other Staff
| Role | Name | Notable Trait |
|------|------|---------------|
| Cleaner | Wayan | Notices Maddie's declining health, assumes it's partying |
| Security | None | Small-town Bali vibe, doors often unlocked |
| Bar/Kitchen | Ketut | Teaches guests to make smoothies; unknowingly provides ingredients |
| Manager | Sarah (Australian) | Remote management, focused on Instagram presence |

### Staff Knowledge
No one suspects anything - food sharing is common and encouraged. The kitchen is always full of guests making wellness drinks. Petra's behavior seems completely normal.

## Hostel Atmosphere

### Day Vibe
Content creation in progress. Guests position themselves around the pool for photos, work on laptops in the co-working space, take outfit photos against murals. A soft competitive energy about who gets the best shot.

### Night Vibe
More relaxed - drinks by the pool, group dinners at local warungs, movie nights in the common area. Cliques form around follower counts and niche (travel, fitness, fashion).

### Guest Demographics
90% under 35. Heavy on aspiring influencers, digital marketers, "entrepreneurs" with vague business models, yoga teacher trainees. Some long-term nomads on work visas. The occasional older surfer who wandered in.

### Reputation
"Perfect for content creation." "Pool is literally amazing." "Fast Wi-Fi, the dream." "A bit try-hard but fun." "Everyone here has an Instagram with at least 10k."

## Real-World Research

### Accuracy Notes
Canggu's digital nomad/influencer culture should be depicted accurately but with satirical edge. The wellness obsession provides cover for poisoning. Medical facilities in Bali are good but limited for complex cases.

### Cultural Sensitivity
- Balinese Hindu culture is central to the island - treat with respect
- Local vs. tourist economic dynamics are complex
- "Bali belly" jokes should not punch down at local food
- Avoid cliches about "finding yourself"

### Sources
- Digital nomad forums and Canggu guides
- Indonesian medical facility reviews
- Ethylene glycol poisoning medical literature
- True crime cases involving poisoning by intimates
